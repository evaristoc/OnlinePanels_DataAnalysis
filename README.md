The main purpose of this repository is to publicly share a (quick and dirty) code I developed while working for an Online Consumer Panel company.

The project attempts to simulate operations associated to Online Consumer (Access) Panels.

By the time of this proposal, objectives of this work were:
- Evaluating the feasibility of simulations for (strategic) decision making support tools in the online consumer panel industry
- Identify critical points for additional business process automation (eg current sample size analysis) or tools for strategic decision making (eg annual recruitment budget allocation analysis) 
- Introducing to/Testing concepts and dynamics as observed in the field / empirical data

Observations:
- For being a 'quick and dirty' sketching demo codes could be loaded when still "unpolished"
- Demos doesn't have a GUI or similar (runs on IDLE or command prompt); there are sections where parameters must be changed manually on the code
- Data / dynamics could be based on sketched models and or arbitrary parameters
