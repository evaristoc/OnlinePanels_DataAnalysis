ONLINE PANEL SIMULATION - SECOND PHASE - Outline

Keeping the same objectives as in the first phase, in this second phase I will continue exploring the simulation. This time subsequent empirical findings as well as variants to accomodate some current practices will be added. The IBRO model (see previous phase) will be emphasised but the general approach to sampling will be developed to evaluate certain dynamics found in field.
Some observations are:

1) IBRO (for Inflow - Base - Retention/chrun - Outflow) model

- Functions better supported by empirical observations to explain survival and response rates per cohort will be used.
- The baseline for a population would be evaluated in terms of a "year-length" horizon instead of a "per project". Either the "week" or "day" as atomic time unit to be decided.

2) Sampling Simulations

- Previous simulation was based on an invitation model of "one invite, one survey". For this phase the now more popular Inbox and Router models will be suggested. This may involve a new class or method to simulate the Inbox per panelist.
