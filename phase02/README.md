ONLINE PANEL SIMULATION - SECOND PHASE - Outline

Keeping the same objectives as in the first phase, in this second phase I will continue exploring the simulation. This time subsequent empirical findings as well as variants to accomodate some current practices will be added. The IBRO model (see previous phase) will be emphasised but the general approach to sampling will be developed to evaluate certain dynamics found in field.
Some observations are:

1) IBRO (for Inflow - Base - Retention/chrun - Outflow) model

- Functions better supported by empirical observations to explain survival and response rates per cohort will be used.
- The baseline for a population would be evaluated in terms of a year-length proposal.

2) Sampling Simulations

- Previous simulation was based on an invitation model of "one invite, one survey". For this phase the now more popular Inbox and Router models will be suggested. This may involve a new class or method to simulate the Inbox per panelist.

EDIT 09-05-2014:
A first (still incomplete) script file was loaded:
- the script give an idea of the direction of the major implementation
- the project use Object Oriented programming as main programming paradigm, which is more suitable for the model
- Panelists and portals are 2 different interfaces that will interact during the sampling procedure

Apart of what it is shown, additional tasks would include:
- A threading procedure for the sampling event
- Likely also a threading for the universe generation by updating Panelist instances status

This script is more advanced than the previous phase, and although won't be scalable to a large amount of records, the use of OO approach will ease readibility, possible extensions and the maintenance of the current script
