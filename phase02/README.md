ONLINE PANEL SIMULATION - SECOND DEMO - Outline

A more developed script that better reflect in-field operations.

A sketched script file was loaded:
- the script gives an idea of the direction of the major implementation
- differently to previous demo, this demo included more Object Oriented programming, which is more suitable to the model characteristics

Keeping the same objectives as in the first demo, in this second demo I will continue exploring the simulation. This time subsequent functions, behaviours and attributes will be added to better fit some current real practices but also some simplifications. The IBRO model (see previous demo) could be emphasised but the general approach to sampling will be modified and upgraded to include certain dynamics found in field.
Some observations are:

1- IBRO (for Inflow - Base - Retention/churn - Outflow) model

- Functions better supported by empirical observations to explain survival and response rates per cohort will be used.
- The baseline for a population would be evaluated in terms of a year-time-horizon proposal, counted in weeks (not days, as previous phase).

2- Sampling Simulations

- Previous simulation was based on an invitation model of "one invite, one survey". For this phase the now more popular Inbox and Router models will be suggested. This may involve a new class or method to simulate the Inbox per panelist.
- For the moment the sampling analysis and the behaviour of the population during the sampling event will be evaluated in weeks, no days as in Demo 01.
- So far the simulated surveys will consist only in ad-hoc ones, but this could be easily modified to include simulations for longitudinal studies of any kind, as well as exclusions.
